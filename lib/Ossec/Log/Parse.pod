=head1 ABSTRACT

Perl interface for parsing Ossec alert files

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This library provides an easy and convenient way to parse the log files generated
by L<Ossec|http://www.ossec.net>.

=head1 Constructor

The base constructor for Ossec::Log::Parse classes is called new. There are
several different ways of calling the constructor, depending on the options you
want to set. In a nutshell, one can either pass no argument (data is read from
C<< <> >>); a string argument, which is interpreted as a file name; a file handle which
is used to read data from; or an array reference that can use all of these
options and set a few more parameter.

=over 4

=item B<new()>

The first invocation of the base constructor for Ossec::Log::Parse. No argument is
passed. The resulting class reads Ossec alert log data from C<< <> >>.

=item B<new('/path/to/file')>

Passing a string to the constructor for Ossec::Log::Parse will read Ossec alert log data
from the file pointed to. If the file pointed to does not exist or cannot be
opened, a fatal error is raised.

=item B<new($fh)>

Passing a file handle to the constructor for Ossec::Log::Parse will read Ossec alert log
data from the filehandle.

=item B<new({ option =E<gt> value })>

Pass a hashref of options to the constructor for Ossec::Log::Parse. Options that
can be given (in descending order of importance):

=over 4

=item B<fh>

Filehandle to be used as data source.

=item B<file>

Name of file to be used as data source.

=item B<diamond>

Boolean; if set to true, data is read from C<< <> >>, if no other data source is given.

=back

=back

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item B<getAlert()>

Read input and return the parsed event data as a hash. Returns
undef when on EOF.

Hash includes: ts, ts.human, type, group, agent.name, agent.ip, location, rule.id, rule.level, rule.comment, source.ip, user, full_log

=item B<fh()>

Return the filehandle data is read from. Returns undef if data is read from C<< <> >>.

=item B<file()>

Return the filename data is read from. Returns undef if no filename was given in
constructor.
